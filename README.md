Heart Disease Image

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on a variety of factors such as age, gender, cholesterol level, and blood pressure. The project uses several different machine learning models to make these predictions, including k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, and random forests.

Data
The data used in this project is the Heart Disease UCI dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains information on 303 patients, including 14 attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, and blood pressure. The goal is to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on these attributes.

Models
Four different models were used in this project to predict the presence of heart disease. These include:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector
Decision Trees
Random Forests
Each of these models was trained and evaluated using standard machine learning techniques, including cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.

Data Preprocessing
The dataset underwent several preprocessing steps before it was used to train the machine learning models. These steps include:

Filling in missing values using the median of each column
Encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding
Standardizing numerical variables using z-score normalization
More details on the preprocessing steps can be found in the code.

Running the Code
To run the code, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the main.py file to train and evaluate the models.
More detailed instructions and examples can be found in the code.
